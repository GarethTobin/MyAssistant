# Info
**Description:**<br>
This project was created in Visual Studio 2022 and I do not have many plans for it at the moment but one. 
I will update the Plans part when I think of things I am planning to make this project do.

**Text Reader:**<br>
The text reader allows you to listen to the text that is in the clipboard. 
To use it just copy what text you would like to listen to then press play.
When the program is minimized it will hide it self from the taskbar and show itself in the System Tray.
Double click it in the System Tray will open it, or right click it to open the option menu to open or close it.

**Text Reader Hotkeys:**<br>
F24 - Play/Puase/Resume<br>
F23 - Stop
